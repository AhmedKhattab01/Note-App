Easy Memo Note App is an Android application developed in Kotlin that allows users to create and manage their personal memos and notes conveniently. The app provides a user-friendly interface and various features to enhance the note-taking experience.

## Technologies Used

The Easy Memo Note App utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

- **Java**: The primary programming language used for developing the app.
- **Navigation Component**: This library helps with implementing navigation and managing fragment transactions within the app.
- **Dependency Injection with Hilt**: Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android apps that simplifies the process of managing dependencies and promotes a modular and testable architecture.
- **MVVM**: The app architecture follows the Model-View-ViewModel pattern, which separates the user interface (View) from the data and business logic (Model) using ViewModels.
- **Single Activity Multiple Fragments**: The app follows a single-activity architecture, where different screens are represented by fragments, allowing for better navigation and modularization.
- **Lottie Animation**: Lottie is an animation library that enables the integration of beautiful and engaging animations into the app, enhancing the user experience.
- **Room Database**: Room is a persistence library provided by Android Jetpack, offering an abstraction layer over SQLite and facilitating the management of local data storage.
- **Repository Pattern**: The app implements the repository pattern, providing a clean separation between the data sources and the rest of the app, making it easier to manage and retrieve data.
- **Shared Preferences**: Shared Preferences is a lightweight data storage mechanism provided by Android, used in the app to store user preferences and small amounts of app-related data.
